### Career Profile

I am an experienced cybersecurity professional who built my foundation through hands-on roles in security architecture, SOC operations, and advanced threat protection. Over the years, I have developed expertise in implementing EDR/XDR platforms, network segmentation, and incident response strategies for enterprise clients across industries such as manufacturing, government, and telecommunications. My work at companies like Sophos, TelefÃ³nica, and Mouts IT reflects my ability to design resilient security frameworks, lead deployments at scale, and enhance organizationsâ€™ threat detection and response capabilities. Holding certifications from Fortinet, Sophos, Akamai, SentinelOne, and Check Point, I have continuously advanced my technical depth to meet evolving cyber threats with innovation and precision.

Building on this solid cybersecurity foundation, I transitioned into pre-sales consulting, where I now bridge technical and business perspectives to craft comprehensive IT and security solutions. In my current role, I map client requirements, design complex infrastructure and cloud architectures, and present value-driven proposals that align with both security needs and commercial objectives. By combining technical mastery with strong communication and analytical skills, I help clients achieve secure digital transformation while empowering sales teams with strategic insights. My journey reflects a unique blend of deep cybersecurity expertise and consultative leadership, positioning me as a trusted advisor in enterprise technology and security solutions.
